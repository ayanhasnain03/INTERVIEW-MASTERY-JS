# Decoding behavioral questions
In this article, I’ll translate to you what those behavioral questions really mean and I’ll also give you my answers as an example. Here are the questions that we’ll discuss:
## 1. Tell us something about you ?
My name is Ayan Hasnain. I'm from Ramgarh, Jharkhand, and I’ve recently completed my Class 12. I work as a freelance developer, and I’m passionate about building real-world tech solutions. I'm very interested in your company and excited about the opportunity to contribute and grow here.

## 2. What made you apply to this job ?

## 3. What are your weaknesses ?
One of my weaknesses is that I used to focus too much on perfecting small details, which sometimes slowed me down. But I’ve been learning to manage my time better and focus on what’s most important to deliver results on time.

## 4. Where do you see yourself in X years ?
In the next few years, I see myself growing as a skilled developer, working on challenging projects, and becoming a valuable part of a great team.
