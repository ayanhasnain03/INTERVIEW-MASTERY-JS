# JavaScript Interview Questions

## 1. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted language used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It runs in browsers and servers, enabling rich user experiences through DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous communication.

## 2. What is the DOM in the context of JavaScript?
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a way JavaScript sees and changes a webpageâ€™s content and structure. It lets scripts update the page dynamically.

## 3. Explain the difference between let, var, and const in JavaScript?

- `var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared.  
- `let` is block-scoped and can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.  
- `const` is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned after declaration.

## 4. What is the purpose of closures in JavaScript?

Closures in JavaScript allow a function to remember and access its outer (enclosing) scope even after that outer function has finished running. This helps in creating private variables and maintaining state.

For a detailed example of closures, see the [closures.js example](./closures.js).
